  ABOUT THE PROJECT : The administration of anesthesia is a critical aspect of medical practice, where precise dosage levels are paramount to patient safety. However, determining 
  the appropriate dosage can be challenging and may lead to adverse events if inaccuracies occur. To mitigate this risk, our project focuses on developing an advanced Anesthesia Dosage 
  Level Prediction system using machine learning techniques. Specifically,   we leverage regression algorithms and boosting techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of anesthesia dosage calculations.
